# Bug Fix Summary

## Problem Description
All three strategies (conservative, balanced, aggressive) were returning identical bids of $2,210 (85% of listing price) with 0% win probability, instead of providing differentiated recommendations.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Static Bid Range Generation**
The `get_possible_bids()` function in `algorithm/expectiminimax.py` was generating the same bid range for all strategies, ignoring strategy-specific risk tolerance adjustments.

### 2. **Missing Deep Copy**
In `analysis/strategy.py`, the balanced strategy was using the same base_state object reference instead of a deep copy, potentially causing state contamination.

### 3. **Incomplete Tree Exploration**
The expectiminimax algorithm's chance node was directly evaluating states instead of properly recursing through the game tree, limiting the algorithm to single-depth exploration.

### 4. **Poor Fallback Logic**
When expectiminimax returned None, the fallback was to use the listing price, which could exceed the user's budget.

## Solutions Implemented

### Fix 1: Dynamic Bid Range (expectiminimax.py)
- Added risk tolerance adjustment to bid range generation
- Conservative strategies now start with lower minimum bids
- Aggressive strategies explore higher bid ranges
- Formula: `risk_factor = (state.risk_tolerance - 3) / 10.0`

### Fix 2: Proper State Copying (strategy.py)
- Changed `balanced_state = base_state` to `balanced_state = copy.deepcopy(base_state)`
- Ensures each strategy has its own independent state

### Fix 3: Improved Tree Exploration (expectiminimax.py)
- Added conditional recursion in chance nodes
- Properly explores tree when depth > 1
- Maintains efficient terminal evaluation when appropriate

### Fix 4: Better Fallback Logic (strategy.py)
- Changed fallback from `state.listing_price` to `min(0.85 * state.listing_price, state.max_budget)`
- Ensures fallback bids respect budget constraints

## Testing
Run `python test_fix.py` to verify the fixes work correctly. The test script:
1. Recreates the exact bug scenario
2. Verifies that strategies produce different bids
3. Checks bid ordering (conservative ≤ balanced ≤ aggressive)
4. Confirms all bids respect budget constraints

## Expected Behavior After Fix
For the test scenario (Burnaby, $2600 listing, $2500 budget):
- **Conservative**: Lower bid (~$2,100-2,200) with lower win probability
- **Balanced**: Medium bid (~$2,200-2,350) with moderate win probability  
- **Aggressive**: Higher bid (~$2,350-2,500) with higher win probability

All strategies should now provide distinct, meaningful recommendations that reflect their respective risk profiles.
