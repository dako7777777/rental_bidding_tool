# Algorithm Improvements Summary

## Overview
Based on user feedback, the rental bidding algorithm has been significantly improved to provide more realistic and differentiated bidding strategies. The key issues addressed were:
1. All strategies returning identical bids
2. Unrealistically low win probabilities (0-5%)
3. Bids not centered around market reality
4. Lack of budget flexibility

## Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. Budget Flexibility (NEW FEATURE)
- **Added 10% budget flexibility** for competitive situations
- If your budget is $2500, the algorithm can now recommend bids up to $2750
- Configured in `config/constants.py` as `BUDGET_FLEXIBILITY = 0.10`
- This allows you to be competitive when the market demands it

### 2. Market-Centered Bid Ranges
**Before:** All strategies explored bids starting at 85% of listing (way below market)
**After:** Bid ranges now center around the market median (96% for Burnaby)

New bid range strategy based on risk tolerance:
- **Risk 1 (Very Conservative):** 90-98% of listing
- **Risk 2 (Conservative):** 92-100% of listing  
- **Risk 3 (Balanced):** 94-104% of listing
- **Risk 4 (Aggressive):** 96-106% of listing
- **Risk 5 (Very Aggressive):** 98-110% of listing

### 3. Improved Strategy Differentiation
**Conservative Strategy:**
- Risk tolerance: base - 1.5
- Overpayment weight: 1.3x (more cautious)
- Property value weight: 0.9x (less aggressive about winning)

**Balanced Strategy:**
- Risk tolerance: unchanged
- Standard weights

**Aggressive Strategy:**
- Risk tolerance: base + 1.5
- Overpayment weight: 0.7x (less concerned about overpaying)
- Property value weight: 1.2x (prioritizes winning)

### 4. Rebalanced Payoff Function
- **Reduced overpayment penalty** from 1.0 to 0.6 weight
- **Increased losing penalty** from -0.3 to -0.44 to -0.6 (scales with property value)
- This encourages more competitive bidding while still being value-conscious

### 5. Dynamic Market Adaptation
- Bid ranges now adjust based on market conditions (cooling, balanced, hot)
- In cooling markets, conservative strategies can explore lower bids
- Algorithm properly uses market median as the center point for exploration

## Expected Results

### For Your Test Scenario (Burnaby, $2500 budget, $2500 listing):
**Before Improvements:**
- Conservative: $2,125 (85%) - 0% win
- Balanced: $2,125 (85%) - 0% win  
- Aggressive: $2,316 (93%) - 5% win

**After Improvements (Expected):**
- Conservative: ~$2,350-2,400 (94-96%) - 30-45% win probability
- Balanced: ~$2,400-2,500 (96-100%) - 50-70% win probability
- Aggressive: ~$2,500-2,600 (100-104%) - 70-85% win probability

## Files Modified

1. **config/constants.py**
   - Added `BUDGET_FLEXIBILITY = 0.10`
   - Reduced `OVERPAYMENT_WEIGHT` to 0.6

2. **algorithm/expectiminimax.py**
   - Completely rewrote `get_possible_bids()` to center around market median
   - Added market-aware bid range generation
   - Incorporated budget flexibility

3. **analysis/strategy.py**
   - Improved strategy differentiation with larger gaps
   - Better risk tolerance mapping
   - Strategy-specific weight adjustments

4. **models/payoff.py**
   - Increased losing penalty for better balance
   - Made payoff use strategy-specific weights
   - Better risk adjustment calculation

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test script to verify improvements:
```bash
python test_improvements.py
```

This will:
1. Test your specific scenario with detailed output
2. Verify all improvements are working
3. Test multiple edge cases
4. Show win probabilities and bid recommendations

## Usage Tips

1. **Property Value**: Set this 1-5 based on how much you want the property
   - Higher values increase the penalty for losing

2. **Risk Tolerance**: Set this 1-5 based on your comfort with higher bids
   - 1-2: Conservative (lower bids, lower win rates)
   - 3: Balanced (market-aligned bids)
   - 4-5: Aggressive (above-market bids, higher win rates)

3. **Budget**: The algorithm will now intelligently use up to 110% of your stated budget when necessary for competitive situations

4. **Market Conditions**: The algorithm automatically adapts to the market (Downtown vs Burnaby) and property staleness

## Result Interpretation

- **Conservative**: Best when you're price-sensitive and willing to lose the property for a better deal
- **Balanced**: Best for most situations - balances winning probability with value
- **Aggressive**: Best when you really want the property and can afford to pay a premium

The algorithm now provides meaningful, differentiated strategies that reflect real market dynamics while respecting your budget constraints and risk preferences.
